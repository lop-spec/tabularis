# Query Hacker News with SQL

<img src="/img/posts/hackernews-plugin.png" alt="Hacker News plugin in Tabularis — querying stories with SQL" style="width:100%;border-radius:8px;margin:1rem 0" />

There is a new plugin in the registry: **Hacker News**.

It exposes the [public HN Firebase API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) as a queryable SQL database. Stories, comments, users, and poll options become real in-memory tables powered by DuckDB. No API key, no authentication, no setup beyond installing the plugin.

Fair warning upfront: this is as much a **stress test for the new per-plugin settings system** (introduced in [v0.9.7](/posts/v097-plugin-settings-connection-groups)) as it is a genuinely useful tool. HN made an ideal guinea pig — public API, no auth, rich enough data variety to exercise different configuration combinations. But it does actually work, and the queries below are real.

---

## What You Can Query

```sql
-- Top stories from the last 24 hours with at least 10 points
SELECT title, score, by, epoch_ms(time * 1000)::TIMESTAMP AS posted_at
FROM stories
WHERE time > epoch(now()) - 86400
  AND score >= 10
ORDER BY score DESC;

-- Who posts the most — and how well do they do?
SELECT by, COUNT(*) AS posts, AVG(score) AS avg_score
FROM stories
GROUP BY by
ORDER BY posts DESC;

-- JOIN stories with their top-level comments
SELECT s.title, s.score, COUNT(c.id) AS loaded_comments
FROM stories s
LEFT JOIN comments c ON c.story_id = s.id
GROUP BY s.id, s.title, s.score
ORDER BY loaded_comments DESC;
```

Full SQL is supported: `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, CTEs, window functions — anything DuckDB handles. The `stories` table is always available; the rest are optional and enabled through plugin settings.

---

## Optional Tables

The plugin exposes four tables, three of which are opt-in via settings:

| Table | Contents | Default |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `stories` | Feed items (title, score, author, time, url) | Always loaded |
| `comments` | Top-level comments, up to 3 levels deep | Optional |
| `users` | Karma and bio for all story/comment authors | Optional |
| `poll_options` | Voting options for poll-type stories | Optional |

Enabling `comments` and `users` increases the number of API calls on the first query — HN's Firebase API is item-by-item, so fetching author details for 500 stories means up to 500 additional requests. The TTL and HTTP timeout settings let you tune this trade-off for your connection.

## Plugin Settings in Practice

This plugin was designed to exercise the [declarable plugin settings](/posts/v097-plugin-settings-connection-groups#declarable-plugin-settings-via-manifestjson) feature from v0.9.7. It declares its full configuration schema in `manifest.json`, and Tabularis renders the settings UI automatically — no app changes needed:

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| **Feed** | select | `top` | Which HN feed to load: top, new, best, ask, show, or jobs |
| **Max Stories** | number | `30` | How many stories to fetch (max 500) |
| **Include Comments** | toggle | off | Enables the `comments` table |
| **Comment Depth** | number | `1` | Nesting levels to fetch (1–3). Higher values mean many more requests |
| **Max Comments** | number | `500` | Global cap on total comments fetched (max 5000) |
| **Include Users** | toggle | off | Fetches author karma and bio. Enables the `users` table |
| **Include Poll Options** | toggle | off | Fetches voting options for poll-type stories. Enables the `poll_options` table |
| **Timeout (s)** | number | `10` | HTTP request timeout in seconds for the HN API |
| **Cache TTL (min)** | number | `0` | Auto-refresh data after N minutes. Set to 0 to disable |

The three `include_*` toggles are the main cost knobs. With all three off (the default), only `stories` are fetched — fast, minimal API calls. Enabling comments at depth 3 with a large story count can trigger thousands of requests; the `Max Comments` cap and `Timeout` exist to keep that bounded.

It also uses the [`no_connection_required`](/posts/v097-plugin-settings-connection-groups#no_connection_required-capability-flag) flag — since there is no host or credentials to enter, Tabularis hides the connection form entirely. You give the connection a name and start querying.

## How It Works

Tabularis spawns the plugin as a child process and communicates via **JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio**. On the first query, the plugin fetches from the HN API, builds an in-memory DuckDB instance, and keeps it alive for the session duration (or until the TTL expires). Subsequent queries hit the local DuckDB instance directly — no network round-trips.

The plugin is written in **Rust**. Source is on [GitHub](https://github.com/debba/tabularis-hackernews-plugin).

## Installation

Open **Settings → Available Plugins** and install **Hacker News** from the registry. That's it — no manual download, no interpreter to configure.

Feedback is welcome — particularly on the per-plugin settings UX and what other public APIs would make good candidates for this kind of driver. The pattern (public API → in-memory DuckDB → SQL) generalizes well, and the plugin serves as a concrete reference implementation for anyone who wants to build something similar.
